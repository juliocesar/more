  Expanding lists are cool, but you need to ensure that it works fine with the browser's back
  and forward buttons for usability sake.

  For example: go to <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. When you scroll towards the bottom
  of the page, it will automatically load a few more articles (or when you press the "Many more") link.
  after loading articles like that a couple of times, visit one of the loaded articles. Now if you hit
  the back button, you're back to the home page... with none of the articles you waited to load in there.

  That's a massive fail, specially if you're browsing from a mobile phone. Relying on hash changes is
  safer, since you can control state via the hash, and make sure the page gets built accordingly.

  Though this example is rough and simplistic as far as loading the collections go, it illustrates
  the solution I'm proposing quite nicely. Scroll down and hit the "Load more poems" link a few times.
  Then hit the back and forward buttons.
%section.articles#expanding
  - @poems.each do |poem|
    %article
      %h1= poem[:title]
      %p= poem[:body]
  %a(href="#chunk=1") Load more poems â†“
